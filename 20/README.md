# NiFTree
## Mission Statement:

Everyone has an identity in life, everyone is a unique individual.  A Photo turned NFT to represent, reaffirm, and foster this concept of value is gratifying, fun, and establishes an inherent concept that others are unique individuals as well. A photo, minted into a NFT(s) of individuals has value, and after entering NiFTree, has scarcity!
The Family Tree Photo concept is a beginning, a baby step towards a larger, much larger plan of inclusion.  Friends, large groups of friends, organizations, clubs, sport clubs and so many others can get in on the action as well!

## Use case/Summary Overview:

The problem we are trying to solve is large social media corporations are gathering data on users and using and/or selling persons photographs and pertinent data at their profit. We hope to solve this problem, by bringing value back to the Photographers.  With a NiFTree the user gets to keep photos, store them and trade them and build photo albums, and they have value.
    Identity Value
    Monetary Value (Trade, Sell, Gift)
A sense of being an individual with a stake, share, in something bigger.
This appeals to all our natures, people want to be recognized as an individual, and also want to belong to something, some group that has meaning, focus, fun!

## Methodology:

Build a smart contract using Cadence > using Resources and Mint a NFT of a Photo(s) and resend to Member (Photographer) for storage. (NonFungibleToken.cdc)
  (A family Member or Photographer sends Photos to a Publisher (NiFTree) for minting and recieves a Framed Photo)
  (The color of the Frame will denote scarcity)
Establish collections of pictures via transactions to trade, share, and contain (store) and add to a Photo Collection, or Photo Album.
When a Photo Album is created and multiple members have completed and shared, a group vote for best of show takes place.
Winner recieves special (diamond) Framed Photo.
