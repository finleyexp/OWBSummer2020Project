**Current Limitations**

* The marketplace is not currently setup on the webapp but works with contracts
* The list of ids in a collection is not accurate as there can be duplicate ids
* The security of the contracts has not been double-checked :
    * Especially we need to make sure that admins can't interfer with others NFTs 
* The list functions are present to simplify the flow 
* Data are retrieve through transaction at the moment to ease the implementation, it should be move to event listening


**Ameliorations possible**

* Allow NFTs to be minted without the action of the owner. 
* Functionality to have decaying FanPoints mechanisms. 
* Setup a better way for admins to administrate their digital collections (Define the minitng number limit)
